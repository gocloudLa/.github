Welcome to the **GoCloud GitHub Organization** — home of our open-source **Standard Platform**, a set of reusable, scalable, and production-grade **Terraform modules** and tools for **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**.

We help teams build modern cloud architectures by codifying **DevOps best practices**, **security-first principles**, and **automation** at every layer of the stack.
